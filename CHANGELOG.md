## [0.1] - [2025-11-08]

This release corresponds with the caldav version 2.1.2

This is the first release, so I shouldn't need to list up changes since the previous release.

This project was initiated in 2023, it was forgotten, I started working a bit on it inside the caldav library in 2024, moved the work into this project in May 2025, and at some point I decided to throw all of the old work away, and start from scratch - to grow the project it's needed with a less chaotic and more organized approach.  I was very close to making a dual release of the caldav library and the caldav-server-tester library just before the summer vacation started, but didn't manage - and then for half a year things were continously happening in my life preventing me to focus on the caldav project.  So this is a very much overdue release.
