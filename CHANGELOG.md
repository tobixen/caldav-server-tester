## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Expanded search feature coverage with new feature flags:
  - `search.text` - Basic text/summary search
  - `search.text.case-sensitive` - Case-sensitive text matching (default behavior)
  - `search.text.case-insensitive` - Case-insensitive text matching via CalDAVSearcher
  - `search.text.substring` - Substring matching for text searches
  - `search.is-not-defined` - Property filter with is-not-defined operator
  - `search.text.category` - Category search support
  - `search.text.category.substring` - Substring matching for category searches
- `post_filter=False` parameter to all server behavior tests to ensure testing actual server responses
- New `CheckSyncToken` check class for RFC6578 sync-collection reports:
  - Tests for sync token support (full/fragile/unsupported)
  - Detects time-based sync tokens (second-precision, requires sleep(1) between operations)
  - Detects fragile sync tokens (occasionally returns extra content due to race conditions)
  - Tests sync-collection reports after object deletion
- New `CheckAlarmSearch` check class for alarm time-range searches (RFC4791 section 9.9):
  - Tests if server supports searching for events based on when their alarms trigger
  - Verifies correct filtering of alarm times vs event times

### Changed
- Improved `search.comp-type-optional` test with additional text search validation

### Fixed
- `create-calendar` feature detection to not incorrectly mark mkcol method as standard calendar creation

## [0.1] - [2025-11-08]

This release corresponds with the caldav version 2.1.2

This is the first release, so I shouldn't need to list up changes since the previous release.

This project was initiated in 2023, it was forgotten, I started working a bit on it inside the caldav library in 2024, moved the work into this project in May 2025, and at some point I decided to throw all of the old work away, and start from scratch - to grow the project it's needed with a less chaotic and more organized approach.  I was very close to making a dual release of the caldav library and the caldav-server-tester library just before the summer vacation started, but didn't manage - and then for half a year things were continously happening in my life preventing me to focus on the caldav project.  So this is a very much overdue release.
